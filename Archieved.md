This repo is archived, since its creation in 2017, 
it has helped me understand how a system to process large scale video and image collections can be built. 

However due to lack of time available as well as potential for misuse, I have ceased public development. 
Its likely that I will dedicate time in near future to this project or some other avatar of it. 
For academic purposes I have decided to keep the repo public and online for now.
