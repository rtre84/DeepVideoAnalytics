Deep Video Analytics is a platform for indexing and extracting information from videos and images.
With latest version of docker installed correctly, you can run Deep Video Analytics in minutes
locally (even without a GPU) using a single command.

#### May 2019 Update: Over the last few months I have been developing DVA on a private repo and will be updating the public version in Fall 2019. 

### Installation & Overview

For installation instructions and overview please visit
[https://www.deepvideoanalytics.com](https://www.deepvideoanalytics.com) and go through the presentation. The
standalone OCR example has been moved to [/docs/experiments/ocr](/docs/experiments/ocr) directory.

### Google Cloud Platform

Deep Video Analytics recommends Google Cloud Platform and is configured to work out of box.

### Architecture

Deep Video Analytics implements a client-server architecture pattern, where clients can access state of the server
via a REST API. For uploading, processing data, training models, performing queries, i.e. mutating the state
clients can send DVAPQL (Deep Video Analytics Processing and Query Language) formatted as JSON. Each query represents
a directed acyclic graph of operations.
